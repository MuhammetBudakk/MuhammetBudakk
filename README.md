Hello, I am Muhammet Budak, a civil engineer. I am a first year student of Management Information Systems.

I am improving myself in the front-end department. I am open to learning and follow new technologies closely.

I am currently actively learning Javascript. I started developing websites using HTML5 CSS3 and Bootstrap 2 months ago.

Even though I have added a lot to myself since the first time I started software, there are still many things I do not know.

My current greatest passion is to research, learn and apply.

I would like to be able to work together on projects. So that you can contact me about my projects etc.

My e-mail address is in my profile.

Thank you for visiting my profile.

My hobbies are playing basketball and table tennis, my phobias are winged animals :)
